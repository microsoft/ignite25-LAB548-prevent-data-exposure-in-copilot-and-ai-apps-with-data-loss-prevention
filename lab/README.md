These instructions are for participants of the **instructor-led** Workshop **Implement and Manage Data Loss Prevention policies** at Microsoft AI Tour 2026.  Register to attend in a city near you at [Microsoft AI Tour](https://aitour.microsoft.com/).

## Lab Overview

In this hands-on workshop, you'll use Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) to protect sensitive data across Microsoft 365 Copilot and AI environments. You'll create and test DLP policies, configure endpoint restrictions for AI websites, and optionally enable Adaptive Protection to apply safeguards dynamically based on user risk.

If you're not attending AI Tour, you can still complete this lab using your own Microsoft 365 E5 environment with Microsoft Purview DLP, Insider Risk Management, and Adaptive Protection enabled.

1. Access to the Microsoft Purview portal (https://purview.microsoft.com)
